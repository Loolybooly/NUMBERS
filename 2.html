                    <h2>Why 73?</h2>
                    <p>
                        73 is a prime number, the 21st prime number, and the
                        smallest prime number that is not a twin prime. If you
                        reverse the digits, you get 37, which is not only a
                        prime number, but the 12th prime number. 73 is also made
                        up of 7 and 3, which are both prime numbers. and if you
                        add them together, you get 10, which is a composite
                        number. Additionally, 73 is a happy number, meaning that
                        if you repeatedly replace the number by the sum of the
                        squares of its digits, you will eventually reach 1.

                    <h2>How I Found This Number</h2>
                    <p>
                        I found the number 73 when I was just getting into math,
                        7+3 was equal to 10, I combined 7 and 3 to get 73. and
                        then I realized that 73 is a prime number. I reversed 73
                        and got 37, which is also a prime number. From there 73
                        Became my 2nd favorite number.
